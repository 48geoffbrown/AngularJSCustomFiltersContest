## Mini Project: Case Conversion Filters

AngularJS already comes with two built-in case filters: uppercase and lowercase.

Youâ€™re working on a team that needs the following case filters:

* Title case (Title Case)
* Swap case (sWAP cASE)
* Snake case (snake-case)
* Lower camel case (lowerCamelCase)
* SQL case (CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES)

You will form in teams of 4 max (one team per table?) and implement one of the cases assigned to you. You will clone this project and create a branch. Once completed, create a PR to submit your changes. We will see each of the implementations in action at the end of class and see how well everyone did. Have fun!
